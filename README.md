Billionaires Analysis ML Project

-- This project is an ML analysis of the Forbes Billionaires List from 2021. The goal is to analyze the data on billionaires and use machine learning algorithms to gain        insights into the characteristics and trends of billionaires.

Dataset
-- The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from the Forbes Billionaires List for 2021, which contains information on the net worth, age, source of wealth, industry,      and country of residence for over 2,000 billionaires. The dataset is available as a CSV file and is included in the repository.

Methodology
-- The analysis is performed in Python using various machine learning algorithms and data visualization libraries. The following steps are taken:

   Data cleaning and preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed to remove any missing values, outliers, or duplicates.

   Exploratory data analysis (EDA): The data is visualized and analyzed to gain insights into the characteristics of billionaires. The EDA includes summary statistics,        histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices.

   Feature engineering: Additional features are created from the existing features to improve the performance of the machine learning models. For example, the age of a        billionaire may be converted into a categorical variable.

Machine learning modeling: Various machine learning algorithms are trained on the dataset to predict the net worth of a billionaire based on the other features. The algorithms include linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks.

Model evaluation: The performance of the machine learning models is evaluated using various metrics, such as mean squared error and R-squared. The best model is selected based on its performance on the test set.

Results
The analysis reveals interesting insights into the characteristics of billionaires, such as:

The average age of a billionaire is 63 years old.
The most common source of wealth for billionaires is in the technology industry.
The net worth of a billionaire is positively correlated with their age and the number of years they have been on the Forbes Billionaires List.
The best machine learning model for predicting the net worth of a billionaire achieves an R-squared score of 0.8 on the test set.

Conclusion
This ML analysis of billionaires provides valuable insights into the characteristics and trends of billionaires. The code and results are available in this repository for others to reproduce and build upon.
